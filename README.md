# K53 Learners PWA 

**A project that is aimed at South Africans who cannot find great content on the internet for the K53 learners exam**

The project aims to provide the user with courses and examinations on the courses that are provided. All of this will be provided through a PWA ([Progressive Web App](https://medium.com/@amberleyjohanna/seriously-though-what-is-a-progressive-web-app-56130600a093))

## Why?

So here is a little backstory on why i decided to start this project... Back in June 2018, i was studying for my K53 learners exam and i did not feel like reading boring books. I look for content online and what i found was not appealing and it felt lacking in information. So the project was born üôå 

## Main PWA features?

Currently the project uses caching for offline capabilities and maybe later in the future push notifications can be built in. The project is barely a week old, so there is still a lot of work to be done üòÅ
